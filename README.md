# FRC Team 9597 Robot Code

Welcome to the official repository for **FRC Team 9597**! This repository contains the source code for our competition robot, designed and programmed for the **FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) 2025** season.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows the Command-based FRC Java project structure:

- **Subsystems/**: Contains the major subsystems of the robot, including:
  - `Claw.java`: Controls the claw mechanism.
  - `Elevator.java`: Manages the vertical movement system.
  - `Intake.java`: Handles the intake mechanism for game pieces.
  - `Candle.java`: Controls the LED lights on the robot.
  - `DeepCage.java`: _(Description to be added)_
- **Robot.java**: The main robot class that implements the robot lifecycle (init, periodic updates, etc.).
- **RobotContainer.java**: Binds commands to buttons and initializes subsystems.
- **Main.java**: Entry point for the robot program.
